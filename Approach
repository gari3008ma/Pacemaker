The ECG signals used in the development and testing of the biomedical signal processing algorithms are mainly from three sources: 1) Biomedical databases (e.g.,Â MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database) or other pre-recorded ECG data; 2) ECG simulator; 3) Real-time ECG data acquisition.
In this example, the following pre-recorded and simulated ECG signals are used. The signals all have sampling frequencies of 360 Hz.
First of all we took an arrhythmic data and plotted its ECG waveform.
Next we calculated its BPM with the help of a Matlab code.
Then the HRV (Heart Rate Variability) was calculated.
Now, where ever the heart beat is lower than 60 bpm, the pacemaker will send an impulse to restore the heart beat to a normal pacing, i.e. 60-100bpm.
The impulse will be of magnitude -50mv for 2ms, and it has a refractory period of 200-300ms.
The connected Arduino will flash the LED where ever there is an impulse shoot.
We have also portrayed how the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) would be after the model has completed its simulation.
